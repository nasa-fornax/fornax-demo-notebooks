# Cross-matching ZTF and Pan-STARRS 1 using LSDB


[LSDB](https://lsdb.io) is a useful package for performing large cross-matches between source catalogs. It's built to run across multiple nodes with Dask parallelization, but even without parallelization it is high-performance. In this use case demonstration, we will benchmark the performance of LSDB on the NASA Fornax platform with and without Dask.
