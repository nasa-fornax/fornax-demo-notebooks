# Data - Spectroscopy

This directory is used for data that is downloaded or otherwise retrieved for the spectroscopy use case. Users may
also store additional data here. Note that there is a separate directory for output generated by the notebooks or
its users.

Data should not be committed to the code repository. This directory is included in the .gitignore file to prevent
accidental commits.
