# Make Multi-Wavelength Light Curves Using Archival Data


## Learning Goals
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
  * Automatically load a catalog of target sources
  * Automatically & efficiently search NASA and non-NASA resources for the light curves of up to ~500 targets
  * Store & manipulate light curves in a Pandas MultiIndex dataframe
  * Plot all light curves on the same plot


## Introduction:
 * A user has a sample of interesting targets for which they would like to see a plot of available archival light curves.  We start with a small set of changing look AGN from Yang et al., 2018, which are automatically downloaded. Changing look AGN are cases where the broad emission lines appear or disappear (and not just that the flux is variable).

 * We model light curve plots after van Velzen et al. 2021.  We search through a curated list of time-domain NASA holdings as well as non-NASA sources.  HEASARC catalogs used are Fermi and Beppo-Sax, IRSA catalogs used are ZTF and WISE, and MAST catalogs used are Pan-STARRS, TESS, Kepler, and K2.  Non-NASA sources are Gaia and IceCube. This list is generalized enough to include many types of targets to make this notebook interesting for many types of science.  All of these time-domain archives are searched in an automated and efficient fashion using astroquery, pyvo, pyarrow or APIs.

 * Light curve data storage is a tricky problem.  Currently we are using a MultiIndex Pandas dataframe, as the best existing choice for right now.  One downside is that we need to manually track the units of flux and time instead of relying on an astropy storage scheme which would be able to do some of the units worrying for us (even astropy can't do all magnitude to flux conversions).  Astropy does not currently have a good option for multi-band light curve storage.

 * This notebook walks through the individual steps required to collect the targets and their light curves and create figures. It also shows how to speed up the collection of light curves using python's `multiprocessing`. This is expected to be sufficient for up to ~500 targets. For a larger number of targets, consider using the bash script demonstrated in the neighboring notebook [scale_up](scale_up.md).

 * ML work using these time-series light curves is in two neighboring notebooks: [ML_AGNzoo](ML_AGNzoo.md) and [light_curve_classifier](light_curve_classifier.md).

## 1. Define the sample
We define here a "gold" sample of spectroscopically confirmed changing look AGN and quasars. This sample includes both objects which change from type 1 to type 2 and also the opposite.  Future studies may want to treat these as separate objects or separate QSOs from AGN.  Bibcodes for the samples used are listed next to their functions for reference.

Significant work went into the functions which grab the samples from the papers.  They use Astroquery, NED, SIMBAD, Vizier, and in a few cases grab the tables from the html versions of the paper.  There are trickeries involved in accessing coordinates from tables in the literature. Not every literature table is stored in its entirety in all of these resources, so be sure to check that your chosen method is actually getting the information that you see in the paper table.  Warning: You will get false results if using NED or SIMBAD on a table that has more rows than are printed in the journal.

```{code-cell} ipython3
t1 = time.time()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Build up the sample
# Initially set up lists to hold the coordinates and their reference paper name as a label
coords =[]
labels = []

# Choose your own adventure:

#get_lamassa_sample(coords, labels)  #2015ApJ...800..144L
#get_macleod16_sample(coords, labels) #2016MNRAS.457..389M

# Remove duplicates, attach an objectid to the coords,
# convert to astropy table to keep all relevant info together
sample_table = clean_sample(coords, labels)

#give this sample a name for use in saving files
sample_name = "yang_CLAGN"
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
sample_table
```

### 1.1 Build your own sample

To build your own sample, you can follow the examples of functions above to grab coordinates from your favorite literature resource,

or

You can use [astropy's read](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/ascii/read.html) function to read in an input table
to an [astropy table](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/table/)

+++

### 1.2 Write out your sample to disk

At this point you may wish to write out your sample to disk and reuse that in future work sessions, instead of creating it from scratch again.

For the format of the save file, we would suggest to choose from various formats that fully support astropy objects(eg., SkyCoord).  One example that works is Enhanced Character-Separated Values or ['ecsv'](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/ascii/ecsv.html)

```{code-cell} ipython3
savename_sample = f"output/{sample_name}_sample.ecsv"
sample_table.write(savename_sample, format='ascii.ecsv', overwrite = True)
```

### 1.3 Load the sample table from disk

Do only this step from this section when you have a previously generated sample table

```{code-cell} ipython3
#sample_table = Table.read(savename_sample, format='ascii.ecsv')
```

### 1.4 Initialize data structure to hold the light curves

```{code-cell} ipython3
# We wrote our own class for a Pandas MultiIndex [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) for storing the light curves
# This class helps simplify coding of common uses for the DataFrame.
df_lc = MultiIndexDFObject()
```

## 2. Find light curves for these targets in NASA catalogs
We search a curated list of time-domain catalogs from NASA astrophysics archives.  Because each archive is different, and in many cases each catalog is different, each function to access a catalog is necessarily specialized to the location and format of that particular catalog.

+++

### 2.1 HEASARC: FERMI & Beppo SAX
The function to retrieve HEASARC data accesses the HEASARC archive using a pyvo search with a table upload.  This is the fastest way to access data from HEASARC catalogs at scale.

While these aren't strictly light curves, we would like to track if there are gamma rays detected in advance of any change in the CLAGN light curves. We store these gamma ray detections as single data points.  Because gamma ray detections typically have very large error radii, our current technique is to keep matches in the catalogs within some manually selected error radius, currently defaulting to 1 degree for Fermi and 3 degrees for Beppo SAX.  These values are chosen based on a histogram of all values for those catalogs.

```{code-cell} ipython3
start_serial = time.time()  #keep track of all serial archive calls to compare later with parallel archive call time
heasarcstarttime = time.time()

# What is the size of error_radius for the catalogs that we will accept for our cross-matching?
# in degrees; chosen based on histogram of all values for these catalogs
max_fermi_error_radius = str(1.0)
max_sax_error_radius = str(3.0)

# catalogs to query and their corresponding max error radii
heasarc_catalogs = {"FERMIGTRIG": max_fermi_error_radius, "SAXGRBMGRB": max_sax_error_radius}

# get heasarc light curves in the above curated list of catalogs
df_lc_HEASARC = heasarc_get_lightcurves(sample_table, catalog_error_radii=heasarc_catalogs)

# add the resulting dataframe to all other archives
df_lc.append(df_lc_HEASARC)

print('heasarc search took:', time.time() - heasarcstarttime, 's')
```

### 2.2 IRSA: ZTF
The function to retrieve ZTF light curves accesses a parquet version of the ZTF catalog stored in the cloud using pyarrow.  This is the fastest way to access the ZTF catalog at scale.  The ZTF [API](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/program_interface/ztf_lightcurve_api.html) is available for small sample searches.  One unique thing about this function is that it has parallelization built in to the function itself.

```{code-cell} ipython3
ZTFstarttime = time.time()

# get ZTF lightcurves
# use the nworkers arg to control the amount of parallelization in the data loading step
df_lc_ZTF = ztf_get_lightcurves(sample_table, nworkers=6)

# add the resulting dataframe to all other archives
df_lc.append(df_lc_ZTF)

print('ZTF search took:', time.time() - ZTFstarttime, 's')
```

### 2.3 IRSA: WISE

We use the unWISE light curves catalog ([Meisner et al., 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AJ....165...36M/abstract)) which ties together all WISE & NEOWISE 2010 - 2020 epochs.  Specifically it combines all observations at a single epoch to achieve deeper mag limits than individual observations alone.

The function to retrieve WISE light curves accesses an IRSA generated version of the catalog in parquet format being stored in the AWS cloud [Open Data Repository](https://registry.opendata.aws/collab/nasa/)

```{code-cell} ipython3
WISEstarttime = time.time()

bandlist = ['W1', 'W2']  #list of the WISE band names
WISE_radius = 1.0  # arcsec
# get WISE light curves
df_lc_WISE = wise_get_lightcurves(sample_table, radius=WISE_radius, bandlist=bandlist)

# add the resulting dataframe to all other archives
df_lc.append(df_lc_WISE)

print('WISE search took:', time.time() - WISEstarttime, 's')
```

### 2.4 MAST: Pan-STARRS
The function to retrieve lightcurves from Pan-STARRS currently uses their API; based on this [example](https://ps1images.stsci.edu/ps1_dr2_api.html).  This search is not efficient at scale and we expect it to be replaced in the future.

```{code-cell} ipython3
panstarrsstarttime = time.time()

panstarrs_search_radius = 1.0 # search radius in arcsec
# get panstarrs light curves
df_lc_panstarrs = panstarrs_get_lightcurves(sample_table, panstarrs_search_radius)

# add the resulting dataframe to all other archives
df_lc.append(df_lc_panstarrs)

print('Panstarrs search took:', time.time() - panstarrsstarttime, 's')

# Warnings from the panstarrs query about both NESTED and margins are known issues
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Save the data for future use with ML notebook
parquet_savename = "output/df_lc_panstarrs.parquet"
#df_lc.data.to_parquet(parquet_savename)
#print("file saved!")


# Could load a previously saved file in order to plot
#parquet_loadname = 'output/df_lc_090723_yang.parquet'
df_lc = MultiIndexDFObject()
df_lc.data = pd.read_parquet(parquet_savename)
#print("file loaded!")
```

### 2.5 MAST: TESS, Kepler and K2
The function to retrieve lightcurves from these three missions currently uses the open source package [`lightKurve`](https://docs.lightkurve.org/index.html).  This search is not efficient at scale and we expect it to be replaced in the future.

```{code-cell} ipython3
lightkurvestarttime = time.time()

TESS_search_radius = 1.0  #arcseconds
# get TESS/Kepler/K2 light curves
df_lc_TESS = tess_kepler_get_lightcurves(sample_table, radius=TESS_search_radius)

# add the resulting dataframe to all other archives
df_lc.append(df_lc_TESS)

print('TESS/Kepler/K2 search took:', time.time() - lightkurvestarttime, 's')

# LightKurve will return an "Error" when it doesn't find a match for a target
# These are not real errors and can be safely ignored.
```

### 2.6 MAST: Hubble Catalog of Variables ([HCV](https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/hcv))
The function to retrieve lightcurves from HCV currently uses their API; based on this [example](https://archive.stsci.edu/hst/hsc/help/HCV/HCV_API_demo.html). This search is not efficient at scale and we expect it to be replaced in the future.

```{code-cell} ipython3
HCVstarttime = time.time()

HCV_radius = 1.0/3600.0 # radius = 1 arcsec
# get HCV light curves
df_lc_HCV = hcv_get_lightcurves(sample_table, radius=HCV_radius)

# add the resulting dataframe to all other archives
df_lc.append(df_lc_HCV)

print('HCV search took:', time.time() - HCVstarttime, 's')
```

## 3. Find light curves for these targets in relevant, non-NASA catalogs

+++

### 3.1 Gaia
The function to retrieve Gaia light curves accesses the Gaia DR3 "source lite" catalog using an astroquery search with a table upload to do the join with the Gaia photometry. This is currently the fastest way to access light curves from Gaia at scale.

```{code-cell} ipython3
gaiastarttime = time.time()

# get Gaia light curves
df_lc_gaia = gaia_get_lightcurves(sample_table, search_radius=1/3600, verbose=0)

# add the resulting dataframe to all other archives
df_lc.append(df_lc_gaia)

print('gaia search took:', time.time() - gaiastarttime, 's')
```

### 3.3 IceCube neutrinos

There are several [catalogs](https://icecube.wisc.edu/data-releases/2021/01/all-sky-point-source-icecube-data-years-2008-2018) (basically one for each year of IceCube data from 2008 - 2018). The following code creates a large catalog by combining
all the yearly catalogs.
The IceCube catalog contains Neutrino detections with associated energy and time and approximate direction (which is uncertain by half-degree scales....). Usually, for active events only one or two Neutrinos are detected, which makes matching quite different compared to "photons". For our purpose, we will list the top 3 events in energy that are within a given distance to the target.

This time series (time vs. neutrino energy) information is similar to photometry. We choose to storing time and energy in our data structure, leaving error = 0. What is __not__ stored in this format is the distance or angular uncertainty of the event direction.

```{code-cell} ipython3
icecubestarttime = time.time()

# get icecube data points
df_lc_icecube = icecube_get_lightcurves(sample_table, icecube_select_topN=3)

# add the resulting dataframe to all other archives
df_lc.append(df_lc_icecube)

print('icecube search took:', time.time() - icecubestarttime, 's')
end_serial = time.time()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# benchmarking
print('total time for serial archive calls is ', end_serial - start_serial, 's')
```

## 4. Parallel processing the archive calls

This section shows how to increase the speed of the multi-archive search by running the calls in parallel using python's `multiprocessing` library.
This can be a convenient and efficient method for small to medium sample sizes.
One drawback is that error messages tend to get lost in the background and never displayed for the user.
Running this on very large samples may fail because of the way the platform is setup to cull sessions which appear to be inactive.
For sample sizes >~500 and/or improved logging and monitoring options, consider using the bash script demonstrated in the related tutorial notebook [scale_up](scale_up.md).

```{code-cell} ipython3
# number of workers to use in the parallel processing pool
# this should equal the total number of archives called
n_workers = 8

# keyword arguments for the archive calls
heasarc_kwargs = dict(catalog_error_radii={"FERMIGTRIG": "1.0", "SAXGRBMGRB": "3.0"})
ztf_kwargs = dict(nworkers=None)  # the internal parallelization is incompatible with Pool
wise_kwargs = dict(radius=1.0, bandlist=['W1', 'W2'])
panstarrs_search_radius_lsdb = 1.0 # arcsec
tess_kepler_kwargs = dict(radius=1.0)
hcv_kwargs = dict(radius=1.0/3600.0)
gaia_kwargs = dict(search_radius=1/3600, verbose=0)
icecube_kwargs = dict(icecube_select_topN=3)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
parallel_starttime = time.time()

# start a multiprocessing pool and run all the archive queries
parallel_df_lc = MultiIndexDFObject()  # to collect the results
callback = parallel_df_lc.append  # will be called once on the result returned by each archive
with mp.Pool(processes=n_workers) as pool:

    # start the processes that call the archives
    pool.apply_async(heasarc_get_lightcurves, args=(sample_table,), kwds=heasarc_kwargs, callback=callback)
    #pool.apply_async(ztf_get_lightcurves, args=(sample_table,), kwds=ztf_kwargs, callback=callback)
    #pool.apply_async(wise_get_lightcurves, args=(sample_table,), kwds=wise_kwargs, callback=callback)
    pool.apply_async(tess_kepler_get_lightcurves, args=(sample_table,), kwds=tess_kepler_kwargs, callback=callback)
    pool.apply_async(hcv_get_lightcurves, args=(sample_table,), kwds=hcv_kwargs, callback=callback)
    pool.apply_async(gaia_get_lightcurves, args=(sample_table,), kwds=gaia_kwargs, callback=callback)
    pool.apply_async(icecube_get_lightcurves, args=(sample_table,), kwds=icecube_kwargs, callback=callback)

    pool.close()  # signal that no more jobs will be submitted to the pool
    pool.join()  # wait for all jobs to complete, including the callback

# run panstarrs query outside of multiprocessing since it is using dask distributed under the hood
# which doesn't work with multiprocessing, and dask is already parallelized
#df_lc_panstarrs = panstarrs_get_lightcurves_lsdb(sample_table, radius=panstarrs_search_radius_lsdb)
#parallel_df_lc.append(df_lc_panstarrs) # add the panstarrs dataframe to all other archives

parallel_endtime = time.time()

# LightKurve will return an "Error" when it doesn't find a match for a target
# These are not real errors and can be safely ignored.

# Warnings from the panstarrs query about both NESTED and margins are known issues
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# How long did parallel processing take?
# and look at the results
print('parallel processing took', parallel_endtime - parallel_starttime, 's')
parallel_df_lc.data
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Save the data for future use with ML notebook
parquet_savename = f"output/{sample_name}_df_lc.parquet"
#parallel_df_lc.data.to_parquet(parquet_savename)
#print("file saved!")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Could load a previously saved file in order to plot
#parquet_loadname = 'output/df_lc_090723_yang.parquet'
#parallel_df_lc = MultiIndexDFObject()
#parallel_df_lc.data = pd.read_parquet(parquet_loadname)
#print("file loaded!")
```

## 5. Make plots of luminosity as a function of time
These plots are modelled after [van Velzen et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.09391.pdf). We show flux in mJy as a function of time for all available bands for each object. `show_nbr_figures` controls how many plots are actually generated and returned to the screen.  If you choose to save the plots with `save_output`, they will be put in the output directory and labelled by sample number.

__Note__ that in the following, we can either plot the results from `df_lc` (from the serial call) or `parallel_df_lc` (from the parallel call). By default (see next cell) the output of the parallel call is used.

```{code-cell} ipython3
_ = create_figures(df_lc = df_lc, # either df_lc (serial call) or parallel_df_lc (parallel call)
                   show_nbr_figures = 5,  # how many plots do you actually want to see?
                   save_output = False ,  # should the resulting plots be saved?
                  )
```
