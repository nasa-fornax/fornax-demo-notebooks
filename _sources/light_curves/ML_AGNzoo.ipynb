    "```\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Work with multi-band lightcurve data\n",
    "- Learn high dimensional manifold of light curves with UMAPs and SOMs\n",
    "- Visualize and compare different samples on reduced dimension projections/grids\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), some of the most powerful sources in the universe, emit a broad range of electromagnetic radiation, from radio waves to gamma rays. Consequently, there is a wide variety of AGN labels depending on the identification/selection scheme and the presence or absence of certain emissions (e.g., Radio loud/quiet, Quasars, Blazars, Seiferts, Changing looks). According to the unified model, this zoo of labels we see depend on a limited number of parameters, namely the viewing angle, the accretion rate, presence or lack of jets, and perhaps the properties of the host/environment (e.g., [Padovani et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.07134.pdf)). Here, we collect archival photometry and labels from the literature to compare how some of these different labels/selection schemes compare.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use manifold learning and dimensionality reduction to learn the distribution of AGN lightcurves observed with different facilities. We mostly focus on UMAP ([Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection, McInnes 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03426.pdf)) but also show SOM ([Self organizing Map, Kohonen 1990](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/58325)) examples. The reduced 2D projections from these two unsupervised ML techniques reveal similarities and overlaps of different selection techniques. Coloring the projections with various statistical physical properties (e.g., mean brightness, fractional lightcurve variation) is informative of correlations of the selections technique with physics such as AGN variability. Using different parts of the EM in training (or in building the initial higher dimensional manifold) demonstrates how much information if any is in that part of the data for each labeling scheme, for example whether with ZTF optical light curves alone, we can identify sources with variability in WISE near IR bands. These techniques also have a potential for identifying targets of a specific class or characteristic for future follow up observations.\n",

    "Here we load a parquet file of light curves generated using the light_curve_generator notebook in this same GitHub repo. With that light_curve_generator notebook, you can build your favorite sample from different sources in the literature and grab the data from archives of interest. This sample contains both spatial coordinates and categorical labels for each AGN. The labels are generated by a bitwise addition of a set of binary indicators. Each binary indicator corresponds to the AGN's membership in various categories, such as being an SDSS_QSO or a WISE_Variable. For example, an AGN that is both an SDSS_QSO, a WISE_Variable, and also shows 'Turn_on' characteristics, would have a label calculated by combining these specific binary indicators using bitwise addition."

    "While from the histogram plot we see which bands have the highest number of observed lightcurves, what might matter more in finding/selecting variability or changing look in lightcurves is the cadence and the average baseline of observations. For instance, Panstarrs has a large number of lightcurve detections in our sample, but from the figure above we see that the average number of visits and the baseline for those observations are considerably less than ZTF. WISE also shows the longest baseline of observations which is suitable to finding longer term variability in objects.\n",

We start by unifying the time grid of the light curves so oobjects with different start time or number of observations can be compared. We do this by interpolation to a new grid. The choice of the grid resolution and baseline is strictly dependent on the input data, in this case ZTF, to preserve as much as possible all the information from the observations.\n",
    "The unify_lc, or unify_lc_gp functions do the unification of the lightcurve arrays. For details please see the codes. The time arrays are chosen based on the average duration of observations, with ZTF and WISE covering 1600, 4000 days respectively. We note that we disregard the time of observation of each source, by subtracting the initial time from the array and bringing all lightcurves to the same footing. This has to be taken into account if it influences the science of interest. We then interoplate the time arrays with linear or Gaussian Process regression (unift_lc/ unify_lc_gp respectively). We also remove from the sample objects with less than 5 datapoints in their light curve. We measure basic statistics and combine the tree observed ZTF bands into one longer array as input to dimensionailty reduction after deciding on normalization. We also do a shuffling of the sample to be sure that the separations of different classes by ML are not simply due to the order they are seen in training (in case it is not done by the ML routine itself)."

    "Now we can train a UMAP with the processed data vectors above. Different choices for the number of neighbors, minimum distance and metric can be made and a parameter space can be explored. We show here our preferred combination given this data. We choose manhattan distance (also called [the L1 distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry)) as it is optimal for the kind of grid we interpolated on, for instance we want the distance to not change if there are observations missing. Another metric appropriate for our purpose in time domain analysis is Dynamic Time Warping ([DTW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping)), which is insensitive to a shift in time. This is helpful as we interpolate the observations onto a grid starting from time 0 and when discussing variability we care less about when it happens and more about whether and how strong it happened. As the measurement of the DTW distance takes longer compared to the other metrics we show examples here with manhattan and only show one example exploring the parameter space including a DTW metric in the last cell of this notebook."

The middle panel shows the sum of mean brightnesses in three bands (arbitrary unit) demonstrating that after normalization we see no correlation with brightness. The panel on the right is color coded by a statistical measure of variability (i.e. the fractional variation [see here](https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept01/Peterson2/Peter2_1.html)).

    "Figure above shows how with ZTF light curves alone we can separate some of these AGN samples, where they have overlaps. We can do a similar exercise with other dimensionality reduction techniques. Below we show two SOMs one with normalized and another with no normalization. The advantage of Umaps to SOMs is that in practice you may change the parameters to separate classes of vastly different data points, as distance is preserved on a umap. On a SOM however only topology of higher dimensions is preserved and not distance hence, the change on the 2d grid does not need to be smooth and from one cell to next there might be larg jumps. On the other hand, an advantage of the SOM is that by definition it has a grid and no need for a posterior interpolation (as we did above) is needed to map more data or to measure probabilities, etc.\n",
