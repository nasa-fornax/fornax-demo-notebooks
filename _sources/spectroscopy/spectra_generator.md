# Extract Multi-Wavelength Spectroscopy from Archival Data
***

## Learning Goals    
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

 &bull; automatically load a catalog of sources
 
 &bull; search NASA and non-NASA resources for fully reduced spectra and load them using specutils
 
 &bull; store the spectra in a Pandas multiindex dataframe
 
 &bull; plot all the spectra of a given source
 
 
## Introduction:

### Motivation
A user has a source (or a sample of sources) for which they want to obtain spectra covering ranges of wavelengths from the UV to the far-IR. The large amount of spectra available enables multi-wavelength spectroscopic studies, which is crucial to understand the physics of stars, galaxies, and AGN. However, gathering and analysing spectra is a difficult endeavor as the spectra are distributed over different archives and in addition they have different formats which complicates their handling. This notebook showcases a tool for the user to conveniently query the spectral archives and collect the spectra for a set of objects in a format that can be read in using common software such as the Python `specutils` package. For simplicity, we limit the tool to query already reduced and calibrated spectra. 
The notebook may focus on the COSMOS field for now, which has a large overlap of spectroscopic surveys such as with SDSS, DESI, Keck, HST, JWST, Spitzer, and Herschel. In addition, the tool enables the capability to search and ingest spectra from Euclid and SPHEREx in the feature. For this to work, the `specutils` functions may have to be update or a wrapper has to be implemented. 


### List of Spectroscopic Archives and Status


| Archive | Spectra | Description | Access point | Status |
| ------- | ------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------ |
| IRSA    | Keck    | About 10,000 spectra on the COSMOS field from [Hasinger et al. (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...858...77H/abstract) | [IRSA Archive](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/Gator/nph-scan?projshort=COSMOS) | Implemented with `astroquery.ipac.irsa`. (Table gives URLs to spectrum FITS files.) Note: only implemented for absolute calibrated spectra. |
| IRSA    | Spitzer IRS | ~17,000 merged low-resolution IRS spectra | [IRS Enhanced Product](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/Gator/nph-dd?catalog=irs_enhv211) | Implemented with `astroquery.ipac.irsa`. (Table gives URLs to spectrum IPAC tables.) |
| IRSA    | IRTF*        | Large library of stellar spectra | | does `astroquery.ipac.irsa` work?? |
| ESA    | Herschel*    | Some spectra | astroquery.esa.hsa | implemented with [astroquery](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/esa/hsa/hsa.html) |

## 1. Define the sample

Here we will define the sample of galaxies. For now, we just enter some "random" coordinates to test the code.

```python
coords = []
labels = []

coords.append(SkyCoord("{} {}".format("09 54 49.40" , "+09 16 15.9"), unit=(u.hourangle, u.deg) ))
labels.append("NGC3049")

coords.append(SkyCoord("{} {}".format("12 45 17.44 " , "27 07 31.8"), unit=(u.hourangle, u.deg) ))
labels.append("NGC4670")

coords.append(SkyCoord("{} {}".format("14 01 19.92" , "−33 04 10.7"), unit=(u.hourangle, u.deg) ))
labels.append("Tol_89")

coords.append(SkyCoord(233.73856 , 23.50321, unit=u.deg ))
labels.append("Arp220")

coords.append(SkyCoord( 150.091 , 2.2745833, unit=u.deg ))
labels.append("COSMOS1")

coords.append(SkyCoord( 150.1024475 , 2.2815559, unit=u.deg ))
labels.append("COSMOS2")

coords.append(SkyCoord("{} {}".format("150.000" , "+2.00"), unit=(u.deg, u.deg) ))
labels.append("COSMOS3")

coords.append(SkyCoord("{} {}".format("+53.15508" , "-27.80178"), unit=(u.deg, u.deg) ))
labels.append("JADESGS-z7-01-QU")

coords.append(SkyCoord("{} {}".format("+53.15398", "-27.80095"), unit=(u.deg, u.deg) ))
labels.append("TestJWST")

sample_table = clean_sample(coords, labels, precision=2.0* u.arcsecond , verbose=1)

```

### 1.2 Write out your sample to disk

At this point you may wish to write out your sample to disk and reuse that in future work sessions, instead of creating it from scratch again. Note that we first check if the `data` directory exists and if not, we will create one.

For the format of the save file, we would suggest to choose from various formats that fully support astropy objects(eg., SkyCoord).  One example that works is Enhanced Character-Separated Values or ['ecsv'](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/ascii/ecsv.html)

```python
if not os.path.exists("./data"):
    os.mkdir("./data")
sample_table.write('data/input_sample.ecsv', format='ascii.ecsv', overwrite = True)
```

### 1.3 Load the sample table from disk

Do only this step from this section when you have a previously generated sample table

```python
sample_table = Table.read('data/input_sample.ecsv', format='ascii.ecsv')
```

### 1.4 Initialize data structure to hold the spectra
Here, we initialize the MultiIndex data structure that will hold the spectra.

```python
df_spec = MultiIndexDFObject()
```

## 2. Find spectra for these targets in NASA and other ancillary catalogs

We search a curated list of NASA astrophysics archives.  Because each archive is different, and in many cases each catalog is different, each function to access a catalog is necesarily specialized to the location and format of that particular catalog.


### 2.1 IRSA Archive

This archive includes spectra taken by 

 &bull; Keck
 
 &bull; Spitzer/IRS
 



```python
%%time
## Get Keck Spectra (COSMOS only)
df_spec_DEIMOS = KeckDEIMOS_get_spec(sample_table = sample_table, search_radius_arcsec=1)
df_spec.append(df_spec_DEIMOS)
```

```python
%%time
## Get Spitzer IRS Spectra
df_spec_IRS = SpitzerIRS_get_spec(sample_table, search_radius_arcsec=1 , COMBINESPEC=False)
df_spec.append(df_spec_IRS)
```

### 2.2 MAST Archive

This archive includes spectra taken by 

 &bull; HST (including slit spectroscopy)
 
 &bull; JWST (including MSA and slit spectroscopy)


```python
%%time
## Get Spectra for HST
df_spec_HST = HST_get_spec(sample_table , search_radius_arcsec = 0.5, datadir = "./data/", verbose = False)
df_spec.append(df_spec_HST)
```

### 2.3 ESA Archive
```python
# Herschel PACS & SPIRE from ESA TAP using astroquery
#This search is fully functional, but is commented out because it is very slow.
herschel_radius = 1.1  
herschel_download_directory = 'data/herschel'

#if not os.path.exists(herschel_download_directory):
#    os.makedirs(herschel_download_directory, exist_ok=True)
#df_spec_herschel =  Herschel_get_spec(sample_table, herschel_radius, herschel_download_directory, delete_tarfiles = True)
#df_spec.append(df_spec_herschel)
```

### 2.4 SDSS Archive
```python
%%time
## Get Spectra for JWST
df_jwst = JWST_get_spec(sample_table , search_radius_arcsec = 0.5, datadir = "./data/", verbose = False)
df_spec.append(df_jwst)
```


This includes SDSS spectra.

```python
%%time
## Get SDSS Spectra
df_spec_SDSS = SDSS_get_spec(sample_table , search_radius_arcsec=5, data_release=17)
df_spec.append(df_spec_SDSS)
```

### 2.5 DESI Archive

This includes DESI spectra. Here, we use the `SPARCL` query. Note that this can also be used
for SDSS searches, however, according to the SPARCL webpage, only up to DR16 is included. Therefore, we will not include SDSS DR16 here (this is treated in the SDSS search above).

```python
%%time
## Get DESI and BOSS spectra with SPARCL
df_spec_DESIBOSS = DESIBOSS_get_spec(sample_table, search_radius_arcsec=5)
df_spec.append(df_spec_DESIBOSS)
```

## 3. Make plots of luminosity as a function of time
We show flux in mJy as a function of time for all available bands for each object. `show_nbr_figures` controls how many plots are actually generated and returned to the screen.  If you choose to save the plots with `save_output`, they will be put in the output directory and labelled by sample number.



```python
### Plotting ####
create_figures(df_spec = df_spec,
             bin_factor=5,
             show_nbr_figures = 10,
             save_output = False,
             )
```
