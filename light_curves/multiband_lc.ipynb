    "# Make multiwavelength light curves using archival data\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals    \n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n",
    " - automatically load a catalog of sources\n",
    " - automatically search NASA and non-NASA resources for light curves\n",
    " - store light curves in a Pandas multiindex dataframe\n",
    " - plot all light curves on the same plot\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    " - A user has a sample of interesting targets for which they would like to see a plot of available archival light curves.  We start with a small set of changing look AGN from Yang et al., 2018, which are automatically downloaded. Changing look AGN are cases where the broad emission lines appear or disappear (and not just that the flux is variable). We model light curve plots after van Velzen et al. 2021.  We search through a curated list of time-domain NASA holdings as well as non-NASA sources.  HEASARC catalogs used are Fermi and Beppo-Sax, IRSA catalogs used are ZTF and WISE, and MAST catalogs used are Pan-Starrs, TESS, Kepler, and K2.  Non-NASA sources are Gaia and IceCube. This list is hopefully generalized enough to include many types of targets to make this notebook interesting for many types of science.  All of these time-domain archives are searched in an automated fashion using astroquery.\n",
    " - Light curve data storage is a tricky problem.  Currently we are using a multi-index Pandas dataframe, but it is not clear that this is the best choice or the best choice for scaling up.  One downside is that we need to manually track the units of flux and time instead of relying on an astropy storage scheme which would be able to do the units worrying for us.  Astropy does not currently have a good option for multi band light curve storage.\n",
    " - We intend to explore two possible extensions to this project.  The first is an image extension where we would search the archives for images of these sources.  The second, is exploring a ML classifier for these changing look AGN light curves.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Input:\n",
    " - a catalog of CLAGN from the literature\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output:\n",
    " - an archival optical + IR + neutrino light curve\n",
    " \n",
    "## Technical Goals:\n",
    " - should be able to run from a clean checkout from github\n",
    " - should be able to automatically download all catalogs & images used\n",
    " - need to have all photometry in the same physical unit\n",
    " - need to have a data structure that is easy to use but holds light curve information (time and units) and is extendable to ML applications\n",
    " - need to have a curated list of catalogs to search for photometry that is generalizeable to other input catalogs\n",
    " \n",
    "## Non-standard Imports:\n",
    "- `astroquery` to interface with archives APIs\n",
    "- `astropy` to work with coordinates/units and data structures\n",
    "- `AXS` (astronomy extensions for Spark) to handle large catalog cross matching\n",
    "- `lightkurve` to search TESSS, Kepler, and K2 archives\n",
    "- `urllib` to handle archive searches with website interface\n",
