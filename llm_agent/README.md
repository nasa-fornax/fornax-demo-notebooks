# IRSA LLM Agent (MVP)

This folder contains a prototype agent that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to assist users with IRSA tools and missions.

### Goals:
- Answer questions about IRSA missions and services
- Point users to the right tools or documentation
- Suggest science projects based on available data

You can run the assistant via:
- `llm_agent_demo.ipynb` — interactive notebook
- `main.py` — command-line script

More setup instructions coming soon.
