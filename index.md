## Tutorial Notebooks

This collection of tutorial notebooks consists of fully worked science use cases for all users.
Common goals of the notebooks are the usage of archival data from all NASA archives, cross-archive work, big data, and computationally intensive science.
Currently, there are four major topics for which we have notebooks, use the navigation menu on the left hand side to explore them.

The notebooks and their run-time dependencies are also available pre-installed at the Fornax Science Console, to learn more about the please consult the [](xref:fornax-docs/notebook-tutorials#notebooks-in-fornax) section of the documentation.

These notebooks are written and maintained using the MyST Markdown format, more details and references about it can be found in the [](xref:fornax-docs#working-with-markdown) documentation section.
