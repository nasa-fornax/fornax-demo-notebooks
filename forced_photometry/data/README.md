# Data - Forced Photometry

This directory is used for data that is downloaded or otherwise retrieved for the forced photometry use case.
Users may also store additional data here. Note that there is a separate directory for output generated by the
notebook or its users.

We also store the instrument specific PRF/PSF files here, do not delete them as the code assumes they are already in place.

New data should not be committed to the code repository. This directory is included in the .gitignore file to
prevent accidental commits.
