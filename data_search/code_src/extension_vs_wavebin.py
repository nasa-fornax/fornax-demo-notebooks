    This function generates a 1D list of candidate emission spatial extents 
    for each wavelength bin of a given spectral cube.

    segmentation algorithm. The desired output is any 1D python list where a
    peak in some way corresponds to an increased chance of a jet being present
    at the corresponding wavebin.


    Input parameters
    ----------
    data : numpy.ndarray
        A spectral cube as a numpy.ndarray,

        second and third axes spatial.

    Returns
